# Swift Packages
A manually Curated List of Swift packages that build with the [Swift Package Manager](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager).  As described [here](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/blob/master/Documentation/PackageManagerCommunityProposal.md#a-package-index), a package index for Swift packages is a long-term goal for the Swift Package Manager.  In the mean time, this temporary list of valid and maintained Swift packages can serve as something of an index.  Note that this index will *only* contain Swift projects that are packages that build using the Swift Package Manager.

## Contributing
At this time, finding Swift packages seems a bit slim.  Thus, contributions to this list in the form of pull requests are welcome!  Before submitting a pull request to add a packager, make sure that the repository you are linking to includes a `Package.swift` file, builds with the Swift Package Manager, and is useful to the community at large.
